# Analyzing responses from the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2020

This is an Exploratory Data Aanalysis of 2022's Stack Overflow Developer Survey (as at 1st September,2022), an annual and longest running survey of software developers (and anyone else who codes!) on Earth. I thought it would be a good idea to analyze information on Demographics, Programming abilities and experience, employment, and Stack Overflow Usage of respondents since developers frequently visit the website. [You can find the raw data & official analysis here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). This Notebook makes use of Python packages like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), MatPlotlib (for Data Exploration), and Seaborn(for some Data Visualisation)

In the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/addy-analytics/STACK-OVERFLOW-DEVELOPER-SURVEY-2022/blob/main/EDA-stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.ipynb), you will learn how I carried out the following steps for the project:

1. Import Libraries

2. Import CSV files

3. Data Processing and Cleaning

4. Data Exploration and Visualization

5. Additional Insights

# Remarks
Here are a few of the insights I came up with:

* The survey appears to be a fair representation of the programming community generally based on the demographics of the survey respondents. However, it receives fewer answers from women and non-binary programmers as well as programmers in non-English speaking nations.

* Despite the fact that the majority of programmers are college graduates, it is impossible to tell from the survey if they graduated with a computer science degree. So learning to code or developing a profession in programming don't require a computer science degree. We also notice that a majority of programmers have online course certificate through Udemy, followed by Cousera and Codeacademy. This makes a positive statement that everyone can learn to code irrespective of the background as lots of credible learning website spring up every now and then.

* A significant percentage of programmers work as remotely, which is no surprise since the inception of COVID-19 with a majority of respondents also working as full-time followed by full-time students. 

* Javascript , HTML/CSS are the most popular programming languages in 2022, closely followed by SQL & Python. The languages that people are most interested in learning are Python and Javascript since they are both general-purpose programming languages that are suitable for a wide range of applications.

* The poll revealed that the majority of respondents had accounts and frequently visited the stack overflow website, proving that it is a dependable platform for all developers.

# Recommendation

The programming industry lacks the necessary diversity. Even if things are getting better, we should do more to assist & promote underrepresented groups, regardless of their age, nation, ethnicity, gender, or other characteristics.
